    "# These notes are about Allan variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The best explanation of Allan Variance is the one of Allan himself:\n",

    "These notes are just reporting relevant formulas for general cases, but I suggest reading the original source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define Allan variance we imagine to have a very stable reference source with frequency $\\nu_0$ and a DUT with frequency $\\nu_1$. Then we define the concept of istantaneous frequency deviation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y(t)=\\frac{\\nu_1(t)-\\nu_0(t)}{\\nu_0(t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is impossibile to measure instantaneous frequencies... a measurement interval must be always provided, so we can create the variable x(t) this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x(t) = \\int_0^t{y(t')dt'} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "That particular average, for a white noise process should converge to zero as t increases, however for non stationary processes (in particular with flicker noise) that might not be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is usually interesting is the average over a smaller time $\\tau$. This is actually often what the measuring instrument is capable of. So this is usually what we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{y}(t) = \\frac{x(t+\\tau)-x(t)}{\\tau} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to write this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{y}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\int_t^{t+\\tau}{y(t')dt'} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "T is another important element to consider, defined as the deadtime of subsequent deviation measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at Allan deviation definition from the epic [Nist online paper](https://tf.nist.gov/phase/Properties/four.htm) written by Allan himself:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://tf.nist.gov/phase/Properties/Properties_images/Image24.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Allan variance is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma^2(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{2\\cdot{(M-1)}}\\sum_{i=1}^{M-1}{(y_{i+1}-y_i)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition would imply to change $\\tau$ for every datapoint but it is also possibile, assuming T is negligible, to combine measurements in groups of n samples giving what is called non overlapping allen variance\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma^2(n\\cdot\\tau) = frac{1}{2\\cdot(M-1)}\\sum_{i=1}^{\\frac{M-1}{n}-1}{(\\sum_{j=(n+1)\\cdot{i}}{y_j}-\\sum_{j=n\\cdot{i}}{y_j})^2}$$\n"
