# Electronic notes
With this material my intent is to present a series of electronic design techniques that I learned during the years and I use on a daily basis.
The references I use will be mainly datasheets and application notes available on Internet.
Thanks to the power of Jupyter notebook and python some of the material shown will be interactive, giving to the reader the possibility to "play" with the concepts.
